My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

The areas of interest are epidemiology; disease surveillance; and governmental intervention programming, implementation, and evaluation.\nI am currently eveloping my skills in data management, analysis, and visualization using tools such as R, Canva, SAS, Python, and ARCGis. I plan to be a friendly and accessible face in the oftentimes opaque world of governmental public health.\nThe image is Amy from Kitchen Nightmares until I get an updated headshot. (You should definitely watch her episode on YouTube).\nCurrently I am working on cleaning and presenting data at CDPH and producing yearly status reports for a variety of reportable conditions. I am also learning about their work with the CDC on updating their data infrastructure.\nI completed my undergraduate at Oberlin college with a BA in Biology and my most recent position was as a Laboratory Technologist at Cleveland Clinic in the Manual Hematology lab.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
