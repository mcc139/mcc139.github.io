# Welcome to my website!

My name is Maleek Cusack and I am an MPH student at CWRU as well as an intern at the Cleveland Department of Public Health. The areas of interest are epidemiology; disease surveillance; and governmental intervention programming, implementation, and evaluation.

I am currently eveloping my skills in data management, analysis, and visualization using tools such as R, Canva, SAS, Python, and ARCGis. I plan to be a friendly and accessible face in the oftentimes opaque world of governmental public health.

The image is Amy from Kitchen Nightmares until I get an updated headshot. (You should definitely watch her episode on YouTube)
